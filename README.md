Othello is a board game (also known as <i>Reversi</i>) for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. This project is an implementation of this game to play on an ARM-STM32 F3Discovery microcontroller.

Also, there is a GUI implementation for this game, which can be used by connecting the microcontroller to a PC using a UART cable to show the real-time actions on the GUI.
